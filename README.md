### Introduction
- Every time a police officer stops a person in NYC, the officer is supposed to fill out a form to record the details of the stop.
- Officers fill out the forms by hand, and then the forms are entered manually into a database.
- There are 2 ways the NYPD reports this stop-and-frisk data: 
    - a paper report released quarterly and
    -  an electronic database released annually.
- We would be looking at the 2015 release of the dataset covering the data collected over the year 2015.
